    "content": "Apple is acquiring Pixelmator, a Lithuanian firm that makes popular Mac-based photo editing tools, pending regulatory approval. Regulatory approval may be an issue - several large companies have had to abandon deals due to opposition from EU regulators. It is unknown whether Apple intends to integrate Pixelmator's features into its own apps or allow the apps to remain separate standalone apps. Pixelmator Pro recently introduced a number of AI and ML tools for adjusting photos and creating masks, vector tools, and support for more RAW photo formats and other design tool files.",

    "content": "A trial testing semaglutide on patients with knee osteoarthritis conducted in 11 countries found that the drug was so effective at treating the condition the participants no longer needed treatment by the end of the experiment. The study involved 400 obese patients who experienced pain when walking. The patients who received the drug lost weight, felt significantly less pain, and experienced more ease of everyday mobility compared to patients who received a placebo. Many of the improvements were due to taking weight off the affected knees, but the researchers think that semaglutide's anti-inflammatory effects also played a role.",
